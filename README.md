## 🖥️ GitView

[GitView](https://github.com/hyoshida1106/gitview) is a Git GUI application.

* Written entirely in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* Uses [JavaFX(OpenJfx)](https://openjfx.io/) for GUI and [JGit](https://github.com/eclipse-jgit/jgit) as Git library
* Runs on the JVM, so it can (and should) run on any operating system that supports the JVM.
